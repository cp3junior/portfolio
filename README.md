# Online Portfolio

Here is my Online Portfolio Project, encompassing my resume, educational history, and a compilation of completed projects. \
While a portion of these projects remains private or has reached their completion, regrettably, I'm unable to provide accessible links for them.

## Technology Used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
It uses `Sass` for styling and `react-router-dom` for navigation. \
Additionally, `TypeScript` has been employed in the project.
