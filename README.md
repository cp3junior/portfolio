# Online Portfolio

This is my Online Portfolio Project that includes my resume, my educational background and the projects I have done.\
Some of these projects are private or has expired so I cannot provide any links.

## Technology Used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
It uses `sass` as styling and `react-router-dom` as navigation.\
I also uses `TypeScript`.
